<noinclude>
{{Template}}
'''A special template for use in ''all'' template pages.'''

== Usage ==

This template should be added at the very beginning of all template pages between 'noinclude' tags:

 &lt;noinclude&gt;
 <nowiki>{{Template}}</nowiki>
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;

A brief description of the template, usage instructions, and output example should also be added between the 'noinclude' tags (as in this template).

The template wikitext must be written between 'includeonly' tags:
 
 &lt;includeonly&gt;...&lt;/includeonly&gt;
