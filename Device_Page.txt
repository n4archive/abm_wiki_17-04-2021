== How to add a new device page to the wiki ==
{{Note|To create a new wiki page, enter the name of the new page into the search field, press enter and you will be asked to create the new page.}}

# Paste the content from below into the new wiki page, for device-specific pages, we are using the naming convention "Manufacturer Device Name (codename)", so for example "HTC Desire (htc-bravo)"
# Adjust the template for your device (edit all CHANGE_MEs, fill out the blanks etc.)
# [[Making_good_photos|Take a good photo of your phone]] and upload it, then put it into the infobox
# You are done! You can now take a look at the [[devices]] page, your device should appear automatically.

== Template ==

<b>Please take the time to fill out this template properly.</b>

With good documentation, more contributors come, and they will be able to build upon your work.

It's really worth it.

Thank you!

{{Note|You can find information about CPU, GPU, Display on websites such as gsmarena.com . You can also enter your device name with the word "specs" into your favorite search engine and you should find the information as well.}}
